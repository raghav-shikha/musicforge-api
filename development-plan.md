- **Auth**: JWT + API keys
- **Docs**: OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Deployment**: Docker + AWS ECS/Railway

### **Core Services**
1. **API Gateway** - Rate limiting, auth, routing
2. **LLM Service** - Music request understanding
3. **YouTube Service** - Search, metadata, download
4. **Audio Analysis** - BPM, key, energy, waveform
5. **Metadata Service** - Enrichment from multiple sources
6. **Template Engine** - Code generation and deployment
7. **Webhook Service** - Real-time notifications
